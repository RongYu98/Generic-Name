Steps I-3-5:
1. When the add button is pressed, it wil:
   A) Create a player, set a variable to it
   B) Set a variable to true, which call a function 
      to store the x,y's when the mouse is clicked 
      to that player's x y array.
   c) When the Add/(Stop Adding) button is clicked 
      again, the variable will become false, and the
      array stops being added onto, everything will
      be set to either null or false.

Basic Structure: 
Program shall run through a global array
Each index of the global array maps to a "Player" with an ID
Coordinates shall be stored in a "Paths" object with indices corresponding to Player IDs
Each time the program loops through the Players array, each player's coordinates shall change based on the position it is moving towards in the Paths object
Once it reached the point, it will move on to the next coordinates

Basic HTML:
1. Background of soccer field
2. Text element to help the user
3. Create buttons
4. Make stuff look pretty

Steps:

Part I: Creation
1. Create the basic html and create the global array.
2. Create a class of players, with colors and arrows, and create ball.
3. Create an "add" function to add players.
4. Create a gloabl function that will take the mouse 
   xy-cords, and store them into an array.

Part II: Action
5. Create a run button that will run through the array.
   If everyone is done, restart and rerun.
   If pressed again, pause.
6. Add a edit button that will tell the program that 
   the next "player" clicked on will become "selected",
   and future clicks should change it's array.
7. Reset button, that will return all players to their
   initial state, before the run button.
8. Delete all button that will wipe the slate clean. 

Part III: Saving
9. Save the current info into a txt doc, only one part
10. Open by reading a txt doc, process it
11. Have a scroll down, change innerHTML to change it.
12. To load formation, scroll through and click select.
13. Create function to set everything.

Possible Ideas to add:
- When hovering over a "player", it's route should be 
  shown by drawing lines connecting the points.
- Once it has reached it's last position, it should do
  something.
- Player Roster, with names, the name will appear when hovering, or maybe on top.
- Health to represent the extent of injuries.

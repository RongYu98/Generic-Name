Plan as of 5/8/16:

Basic Structure: 
Program shall run through a global array
Each index of the global array maps to a "Player".
Each "Player" shall have an array with coordinates.
Each time it loops through the array, each player's
coordinates shall change based on the position it is
moving towards. 
Once it reached the point, it will move on to the
next coordinates in it's array.

Steps:
1. Create the basic html and create the global array.
2. Create a class of players with it's own array.
3. Create an "add" function to add players.
4. Create a gloabl function that will take the mouse 
   xy-cords, and store them into an array.
5. Combine steps 3 and 4.
   Unless add is pressed again, the newly created 
   player shall remain the "selected" one, all mouse 
   clicks will add onto it's array.
6. Create a run button that will run through the array.
7. Add a edit button that will tell the program that 
   the next "player" clicked on will become "selected",
   and future clicks should change it's array.
8. Reset button, that will return all players to their
   initial state, before the run button.
9. Delete all button that will wipe the slate clean.   

Possible Ideas to add:
- When hovering over a "player", it's route should be 
  shown by drawing lines connecting the points.
- The run button should have a pause part to it.
- Once it has reached it's last position, it should do
  something.
- Being able to save the data into something.

Extreme Ideas to Consider:
- Some Players should be faster than others, can pick
  which player is faster to be more realistic
- Being able to load a formation for the enemy.

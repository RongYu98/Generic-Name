Goals:

End of Week 5/16: 
    A prototype, something that works, but not fully, minimum viable product
    The frontend and how it works should be done.
    Perhaps present multiple frontends, as long as they aren't crazy
    Demo of what we have

Week of 5/23:
     Client Meeting 2
     Something that works, frontend need not be fully connected.
     Rate Load factors, how data intensive the project is, so DO boxes aren't overloaded

     WORK
     Demo, solicit work
     get it to work, even if not fully

Week 6/6:
     Client Last meeting
     Delivering the product

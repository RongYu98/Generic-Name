Add:
1. Mouse Down - Where you click will be the place the player is.
2. Mouse Move - As you move your mouse/finger, the locations (x and y) will be added to 2 arrays.
3. Mouse Up - When you let go, a new player is initialized with a unique ID.
   Using that ID, the arrays recored get stored into PATH, with the ID as the callback.

Delete:
1. Mouse Down - Finds the player using the Pythagorean Theorem.
2. If delete is true, set to true by pressing the button, it will delete itself.
3. Because delete is true, nothing else happens for mouseMove and mouseUp.

Select:
1. Once select is pressed, selecting will be true.
2. If a player is clicked on and select is true, then that player will become selectedPlayer,
   and selected will refer to its index.
3. If a selected is not -1, i.e. a player is selected, and selecting is not true, i.e. done picking player, the 'move' and 'up/end' functions will do nothing.
4. Same as Add Step 2 and 3, except instead of a new player, the player is the one at the index selected.
